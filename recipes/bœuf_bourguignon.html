    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Pour chicken stock into a
	medium bowl and sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface,
	allowing each packet's worth of gelatin to soak up stock
	before sprinkling next one on. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
	In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until
	shimmering. Season beef all over with 3 teaspoons of salt and
	1 teaspoon of pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning
	occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10
	minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
	Lower heat to medium; add split carrots, halved onion, and
	garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until
	lightly browned, about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked
	off, about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next
	step.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Scrape chicken stock and  gelatin mixture into Dutch oven. Add
	red wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garni and bring to
	a simmer over medium high, then lower heat to medium to maintain
	simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a
	large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated
	in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch
	oven. Bring back to a simmer then transfer to oven, partially
	cover with a lid, and cook until beef starts to become tender,
	about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
	Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon lardons over
	medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered
	and lardons are lightly browned and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Using
	a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add mushrooms to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring
	occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and
	browned, about 10 minutes; add oil as needed if pan becomes too
	dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and continue to cook,
	stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
	Remove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large
	pieces of carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garni. Using a ladle,
	skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved
	lardons and sautéed carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew,
	return to oven, and continue to cook, uncovered, until beef is
	fork tender, pearl onions are soft but still hold their shape,
	and sauce is nappe, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
	Remove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any
	additional fat from surface. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
	Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with
	parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in
	refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully
	chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.
      </li>
