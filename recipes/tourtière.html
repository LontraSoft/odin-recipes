    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <span lang="fr">Tourtière</span> is a hearty and satisfying French
      Canadian meat pie that's easy to make, so it's a great choice for a
      holiday main course. Visually impressive, relatively affordable, and
      best served at room temperature, tourtière doesn't require any precise
      timing.
